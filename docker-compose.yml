# Allows us to start the stack without touching too much of our local system
#
# note: the application initialization will download/unpack/configure files
#       in the local directory...
#
# ##### Usage:
# 1. Start the database: `docker-compose up -d mongo`
# 2. Start the application:  `docker-compose run formio`
# [3]. Stop the database: `docker-compose down` (add --volumes to clear data)
# [4]. Remove lingering docker images: `docker-compose down -v --rmi all`
