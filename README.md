Form.io: The Form and API platform.
===============================
Form.io is a revolutionary Form and API platform for developers. This repository serves as the core Form and API engine
for https://form.io. This system allows you to build next generation Web 3.0 applications using a simple drag-and-drop
form builder interface. These forms can then easily be embedded within your Angular.js and React applications using the
```<formio>``` HTML element.
